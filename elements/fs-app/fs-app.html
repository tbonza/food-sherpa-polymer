  Food Sherpa (Annotated Example)

  How to Navigate this File with Ctrl+F or Similar
  ------------------------------------------------

  - For the primary user flow step by step, search "Step 1", "Step 2",
    "Step 3", etc.
  - For other interesting things, search "Note: [Keyword]", where
    keyword is something like "Progress" or "CSS." They are several notes
    for each keyword so you can navigate between them with the same search.


  Description
  -----------

  This tiny little app is built with http://polymer-project.org for the 2015
  "Big Data for Social Good" Hackathon on Challengepost. This app lets you
  search Boston restaurants by name, and then displays curated and graded
  data based on food inspection violations.

  Everything is intentionally kept in a single file for the purposes of
  these annotations. If I were to harden this further, I would break out each
  restaurant card into its own element to eliminate the need for the
  restuarant_[id] style attributes seen below.

        Note: Progress

        The paper-progress element with an "indeterminate" attribute
        tested better than an min/value/max based implementation.

        If we wanted to switch it back, it would be the following:

        <paper-progress id="progress"
          bottom fit
          min="0"
          value={{progress.loaded}}
          max="{{progress.lengthComputable}}">

      <div class="core-header">
        Boston :: Food Sherpa
        <paper-button on-click="{{showRubric}}" style="float: right;">View Rubric</paper-button>
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <!--
          Step 1:

          The {{searchTerm}} variable will update upon typing into the
          paper-input, which will trigger the searchTermChanged watcher
          below.
        -->
        <paper-input
          floatingLabel
          label="Search by restaurant name"
          value="{{searchTerm}}"
          id="byName">
        </paper-input>

        <!--
          Step 4:

          When the results is populated below, the repeat attribute
          of this <template> tag loops through each result and renders
          its embedded HTML.

          The code below relies heavily on Polymer's layout attribute system
          which is documented here:
          https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/layout-attrs.html and
          borrows from how Android's layout system works.
        -->

          <paper-shadow id="restaurant-{{result.ID}}" layout horizontal>
            <!--
              Note: CSS

              This bit here is fun. It dumps the letter grade in the class
              attribute and then uses vertical flex to render the grade bar on the
              side of each restaurant card.
            -->
            <div layout vertical>
              <h1 class="grade {{result.Grade}}" >{{ result.Grade }}</h1>

            <div class="info" layout vertical>
              <div class="address">

                  {{ result.City }}, {{ result.State }} {{ result.ZIP }}
                </small>
              </div>

              <!--
                Step 5a:

                When this button is tapped, the showViolations function
                is called, which starts the process of showing the violations
                dialog.
              -->
              <paper-button id="violations-{{result.ID}}"
                on-click="{{showViolations}}">

            </div>
          </paper-shadow>

          <!--
            Step 5c:

            When dialog.toggle is called in the showViolations function below,
            this dialog appears with a darkroom-style overlay (backdrop
            attribute) and opens from the center (core-transition-center).

            For now it contains a very simple table of all the violations from
            each restaurant in the results, since 2010.

            One important thing here is that the content of things like
            paper-action-dialog, paper-dialog, core-overlay are all rendered
            by putting this content a body tag level core-overlay-layer
            element. Thus, the content here is pre-rendered in a hidden state,
            and shown inside the core-overlay-layer element when needed.

          Step 2b:
          The core-ajax element responds to the go() call in the
          searchTermChanged watcher, and then when on-core-response fires,
          handleReponse is called.

          This element is different because it doesn't display anything, but
          is instead a wrapper for the JS necessary to do the AJAX calls.
          this.$.fs_api.* below exposes these functions.

          Note: Progress
          If we wanted to implement the min/value/max attribute version
          of paper-progress mentioned above, we would include a
          progress={{progress}} attribute here.
